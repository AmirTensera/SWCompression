 Error happened during unarchiving Zlib archive.
 It may indicate that either the data is damaged or it might not be Zlib archive at all.

 - `WrongCompressionMethod`: unsupported compression method (not 8).
 - `WrongCompressionInfo`: unsupported compression info (greater than 7).
 - `WrongFcheck`: first two bytes were inconsistent with each other.
 - `WrongCompressionLevel`: unsupported compression level (not 0, 1, 2 or 3).
 - `WrongAdler32`: computed Adler-32 checksum of uncompressed data didn't match the archive's value.
