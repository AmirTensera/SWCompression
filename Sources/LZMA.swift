/**
 Error happened during LZMA decompression.
 It may indicate that either the data is damaged or it might not be compressed with LZMA at all.

 - `wrongProperties`: unsupported LZMA properties (greater than 225).
 - `rangeDecoderInitError`: unable to initialize RangedDecoder.
 - `exceededUncompressedSize`: the number of uncompressed bytes reached amount specified by archive
    while decoding wasn't finished.
 - `windowIsEmpty`: unable to repeat bytes because there is nothing to repeat.
 - `rangeDecoderFinishError`: range decoder was in a bad state when finish marker was reached.
 - `repeatWillExceed`: unable to repeat bytes because the number of bytes to repeat is greater
    than the amount bytes that is left to decode.
 - `notEnoughToRepeat`: unable to repeat bytes because the amount of already decoded bytes is smaller
    than the repeat length.
