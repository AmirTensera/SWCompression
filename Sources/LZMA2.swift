 Error happened during LZMA2 decompression.
 It may indicate that either the data is damaged or it might not be compressed with LZMA2 at all.

 - `wrongProperties`: reserved bits of LZMA2 properties byte weren't zero.
 - `wrongDictionarySize`: dictionary size was greater than 2^32.
 - `wrongControlByte`: unsupported value of LZMA2 packet's control byte.
 - `wrongReset`: unsupported 'reset' value of LZMA2 packet's.
 - `wrongSizes`: size of compressed or decompressed data wasn't the same as specified in LZMA2 packet.
